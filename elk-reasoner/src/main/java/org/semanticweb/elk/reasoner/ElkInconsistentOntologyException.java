 * Thrown when irrelevant reasoning methods are called for an ontology that is

 * inconsistent ontologies, so it is not required that this exception is used in
 * all cases. Callers should not rely on this exception being thrown as a method
 * for checking inconsistency; there are dedicated methods for this purpose.
